# Game Sales Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on video game sales data using Python.  
The goal is to analyze global and regional sales trends, identify top-selling games and platforms, and understand how game sales vary across regions and time.

The project demonstrates the use of Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
